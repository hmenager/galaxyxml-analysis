# Emboss entries on bio.tools

While using ToolDog to annotate existing wrappers from the main Galaxy, I encountered entries on
https://bio.tools where the EDAM terms did not have uri. This concerned tools linked to the
DOI `10.1016/S0168-9525(00)02024-2`.

Therefore, for every tools linked to this DOI, I checked the topics describing the entries and this
is available in emboss\_topics.tsv
